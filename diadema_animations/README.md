### folder "popvect_animations"
animations showing neural activity and population vector as a function of the relative orientation of the sea urchin and the center of the stimulus.
The three animations correspond to the main stimuli used, i.e., a $40\degree$ bar, a $29\degree$ DoG and a $69\degree$ DoG (see corresponding filenames)

### folder "trajectory_animations"
simulations of the behavior of the model in the presence of a $40\degree$ bar, a $29\degree$ DoG and a $69\degree$ DoG (as per corresponding filenames).
